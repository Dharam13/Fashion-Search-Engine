# Fashion Search Engine
A content-based image retrieval system for fashion products. This project uses OpenAI’s CLIP model to generate embeddings from product and query images. The embeddings are stored in a Weaviate vector database and queried for similarity search, enabling Google Lens–like functionality to find visually similar fashion items.
